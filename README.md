🚀 EcoFleetSim - Delivery Robotics and EV Simulation Platform
EcoFleetSim is a web-based platform that simulates full integration with delivery robots and electric vehicles (e-bikes, scooters) for companies like Zomato, Zepto, and others.
It enables real-time trip monitoring, remote control, energy-optimized route planning, live safety reporting, and eco-performance analysis — all without needing any physical hardware.

✨ Features
🛰️ Live Tracking: Track the real-time location of simulated delivery robots and EVs.

🎮 Remote Control: Adjust speed, direction, and behavior of vehicles dynamically.

🗺️ Smart Route Planning: Get optimized routes considering traffic, terrain, and battery levels.

📊 Performance Reports: Detailed trip summaries with energy savings and carbon footprint analysis.

🔍 Safety Monitoring: Detect and log incidents, protocol breaches, and operational errors.

🤖 Simulation Modes: Switch between robot and EV delivery models with customizable environments (weather, terrain, traffic).

🛠️ Predictive Maintenance: AI-driven alerts on vehicle health and maintenance forecasts.

🏆 Gamification: Earn badges like "Eco Champion" and appear on eco-efficiency leaderboards.
